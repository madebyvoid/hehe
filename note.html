        Greetings, my love. I hope everything is well. I hope you can see how much I love you and how much you really mean to me. I don't really like doing these things, but although it took me 5 days and a few tears, I'm still writing this letter for you. I'm sorry for how I am sometimes; I may be hard-headed, lazy, or annoying, but just know that I am willing to change for you. Kept questioning myself every night, if this were to end, would you care? Every time it seemed to me the answer was always 'no'. I have one fear that's killing me inside: what if you will never develop your feelings for me? Like, is this just gonna be an unrequited love? Or do I just let you go so that you will find the one who you will love sincerely? Please be honest with me, do you really like me or not? Let me know while it's early; I don't want you to pretend like you like me, you know it's happened to me before, and I'll die if it will happen again. To be honest, being a hideous guy like me, I'm so lucky to have such a sweet, caring, and beautiful girl like you. Not gonna lie, I worry and think about you all the time, and I know you do the same. Despite it only being 3 months (at the time of making this) of us being bff? or whatever you want to call this, I really want you to be mine. There's just truly one thing I wish in this thing between us; it's that even though we go through misunderstandings or problems, please let's talk it out and let's fix it. I've noticed despite my imperfections, flaws, and mistakes, you still have the courage to stay, and still have the patience to be with me, and I love that, and I want you to be mine forever.
    </p>
